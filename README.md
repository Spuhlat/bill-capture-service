# bill-capture-service
Codebase for main functionality. Managing bills, managing users, splitting calculations.


## Prerequisites
- Go version 1.18

## Getting Started
From the root of the project, run:

```go run .```

to start the server.

Note: that when developing and changes are made, the server will need to be restarted for changes to take effect.

Extra note: There is a vscode setting to build on save so that restarts are not required. I have yet to figure this functionality out.
